        This method implements the accepting strategy for our agent. We follow a model that exists of different phases.
        We included the following phases:
            1. Strictly exploring   0s - 1s     During this phase we do not accept any offer. Since heuristics tell us
                                                that most agents will not offer their best bids in the beginning. This
                                                also allows for building a better opponent model and bidding strategy
                                                that do not suffer from a cold start problem.
            2. Regular              1s - 9s     During this phase we accept bids that have a higher utility than the
                                                one we were about to offer.
            3. Eager                9s - 9.5s   Time is running out, so this strategy will accept any bid that is higher
                                                or equal to highest previously received bid within a set window.
            4. Desperate            9.5s - 10s  This is the last phase, and now it is really time to accept, so this
                                                strategy will accept anything higher than the time dependent reservation
                                                value. If we do not accept any offer the utility would be 0, so it is
